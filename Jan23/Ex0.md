## Problem
Jaime, the lazy guinea pig we all love, has a craze for multiplying all the numbers he sees when walking down the street. We could even say he is very fast doing this task.
Jaime also loves sleeping, but he can’t do it without first doing his multiplications. One of his friends, Jiren, doesn’t like to see him asleep and decided to put a challenge on Jaime, he thought: What would happen if Jaime can’t see the numbers he has to multiply?
After a while, Jiren gave Jaime a fraction a/b and asked the following: What is the value of the multiplication of the first n digits of the decimal expression after the decimal point?
Jaime hurried to answer that in many cases the result will be 0, then his friend, in order to make it more interesting, told him that all the zeros were to be changed by ones before multiplying. For example, 3/96=0.03125, but changing the 0’s to 1’s would be 0.13125, and if the multiplication of the first 3 digits after the decimal point were asked, the answer would be 3. Can you help Jaime solve the challenge of his friend (Jaime is very sleepy right now and if you help him he could sleep a lot)?
